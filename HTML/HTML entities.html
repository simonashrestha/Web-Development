    <div class="hello">
        <p>Hello this is &nbsp;me</p>

<!-- Here we want to display <p> in our website </p>, so we need to use entities like "<p>hello this is me &lt;p&gt;</p>" -->
    <p>This is me &lt;p&gt;</p>

<!-- Similary, we can use pound for this. We can take google references for the entities.-->
     <p>This is how you right pound: &pound;</p>
